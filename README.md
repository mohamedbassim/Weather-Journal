you can modify this app so easily and its ability to improve or be modified in the future is very good and also the code can be read easily.
with comments all along the code page so you (as a programmer) can easily modify anything that you need inside the project whether its style or even to change the way of input you want you can use other ways but zip code there is alot of ways if you are willing to design it for a country that doesnt have a zip code for examble there is so many ways to do that.
